Rebel built-in functions tests:

1. There are more than 370 built-in functions in Rebel.
2. In the beginning, create at least 3 tests for each function.
3. Many functions are overloaded, so in reality there are more
   than 532 functions to test.
4. Use mk-tests-fs to create a sample directory/file tree to test
   filesystem and file functions.
5. Always use .template file
6. File names for predicative functions have the _p suffix
7.  All tests that need to manipulate the default functor use the
context C:C.  This ensures a consistent, protected context across the
test suite.  Do not use the plain symbol C in any test, as it would
collide with this context and may trigger symbol protected errors.
8. Running tests:
   5.1. Run a single test file:
        rebel -q testfile.test.rbl
   5.2. Run all test files:
        rebel run.rbl
