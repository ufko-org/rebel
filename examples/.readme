Example Rebelion

The code is deliberately written with loose, expanded
parentheses to make it easier for newcomers to read and for
me to modify quickly.

Any example can be run by issuing the following command in
the examples/ directory:

```
$: rebel -q example-file.rbl
```

If you have the Rebel executable in your PATH environment
variable, you can add the shebang to the example file like
this:

```
#!/usr/bin/env rebel
```

Then make the file executable using:

```
$: chmod u+x example-file.rbl
```
